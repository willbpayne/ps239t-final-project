Block_Quotes,"[' We fell completely in love with this little piece of Brooklyn. My favorite parts of the day were the peaceful half mile walks to and from the subway - the charming brownstones tucked inside beautiful tree-lined streets and walking past Fort Greene Park were just a couple of the highlights along the way.', 'Safe neighborhood with families, young professionals, artists, retirees and many who have lived in the neighborhood for a long time. This is charming Brooklyn living at its best.', ""Take a stroll to the flea market or farmer's market. Lounge in the park and listen to the sounds of music, children laughing or the dogs barking."", 'The location is fantastic - I could walk/run to Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge easily, which certainly helps in soaking up the NYC atmosphere. [...] There are super-cool cafes and restaurants within a few blocks - and I should add, all recommended by my host (thanks!). I spent quite some time walking around the streets in the environs of the apartment - both day and night - and felt perfectly safe at all times.']"

Lede,"The sort of neighborhood to show outdoor movies and host nearly famous flea markets, Fort Greene makes the most of its tree-lined public spaces. Upscale speakeasies and independent bodegas add to this conspicuously hip Brooklyn neighborhoods overt charm. Although Fort Greene is replete with places to eat, drink, and relax, its convenient subway accessibility affords easy exploration of other NYC neighborhoods."
