Lede,"Civic Center is the heart of New York City government. Big decisions are debated in its big buildings, and well-dressed people with briefcases rush to and fro. Centrally located and teeming with important-looking marble staircases, Civic Center is one of the citys most easily accessible neighborhoodsits served by 15 subway lines! This neighborhood means business, so dont expect to find a thriving shopping district or nightlife options here."
