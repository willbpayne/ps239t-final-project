Block_Quotes,"[""Truthfully, there is so much to do right here in Fort Greene/Clinton Hill (Bars, Restaurants, Bookstores, Movies, Theatre, Authentic Beer Gardens, Trendy Boutiques, Spas, Flea Markets etc) that you could easily never leave and still feel like you've had the NYC experience."", ""Starting as far back as the 1840's this area was known as a fashionable area for the social elite of Brooklyn who would commute into Manhattan by stagecoach. By the later part of the century, the area was lined with magnificent mansions owned by millionaires. Many of these buildings still remain, as do the immense brick factories that boomed during the industrial age. Most of these large factories have been transformed into loft spaces and apartments, much like my own!""]"
