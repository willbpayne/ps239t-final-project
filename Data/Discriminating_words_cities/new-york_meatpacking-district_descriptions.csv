Lede,"Cobblestone streets and converted brick buildings lend the Meatpacking District an otherworldly ambiance at night, when this neighborhood really comes alive. Short skirts mingle with heavily cologned shirts behind bouncers and velvet ropes to dance and drink until sunrise.  By day, Meatpacking Districts myriad boutiques, galleries, and cafes merit exploration. Its up to you whether or not they merit their price tags!"
