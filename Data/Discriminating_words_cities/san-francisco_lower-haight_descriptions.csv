Lede,"This artsy little niche below Haight-Ashbury shares a similar eclectic character, but its bars and restaurants offer a more intimate (and less abrasive) vibe. Although it still sports trendy hotspots with slightly seedy allures, they feel decidedly less traversed than its counterpart's untamed establishments. Lower Haight's cool nonchalance and convenient location make it a choice destination for casual entertainment, day and night."
