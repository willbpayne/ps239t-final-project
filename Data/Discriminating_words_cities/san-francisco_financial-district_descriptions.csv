Lede,"The Financial District is responsible for San Franciscos most recognizable skyline. Beneath the cluster of towers, businesspeople zip through the Financial Districts sleek revolving doors. In this core San Francisco neighborhood, weekdays fly by as suits and cell phones speed walk past shoppers and vendors. If you wander into the Financial District post-happy hour or on the weekend and youre wondering where all the people went, find them at the Embarcaderos Ferry Building, a popular neighborhood hangout."
