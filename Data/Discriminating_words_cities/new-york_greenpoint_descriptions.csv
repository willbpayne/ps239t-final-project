Lede,"A cozy little neighborhood with a strong Polish presence, Greenpoints charming townhouses and cramped shops imbue its streets with a sense of welcomed familiarity. It takes a little longer to reach always-on-the-move Manhattan from this northernmost Brooklyn neighborhood, but basking in Greenpoint's communal vibe is well worth the extra minutes. Also worth the journey? The stellar skyline views of downtown Manhattan from the rooftops of Greenpoints converted warehouses and loft apartments."
