Block_Quotes,"['Cobble Hill is a great neighborhood bordering Brooklyn Heights and Carroll Gardens - all of which are filled with quaint and award winning restaurants (Sushi, Thai, Irish pubs, Americana you name it), shops, French cafes and parks. Admire the 1800s architecture as you stroll through this historic neighborhood - you may even decide to spend the day exploring this area rather than venture into Manhattan.', 'Cobble Hill in Brooklyn is a wonderful area: very family friendly, great shops and restaurants (our kids loved Moo Burger!). Brooklyn Bridge Park is close by, with its epic playgrounds like the Water Lab. And Manhattan is easy to access via the subway.', ' One of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn--so close to a handful of train lines and steps away from great food, bars and shopping!']"

Known for its mom-and-pop shops, Italian meat markets, and boutique shopping, Cobble Hill fits in with its Brooklyn neighbors along Smith Street, Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill. A little bit trendy and a little bit hip, this neighborhood preserves an approachable atmosphere in a picturesque NYC setting."
