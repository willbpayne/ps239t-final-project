Lede,"Mission Terrace approaches San Franciscos outskirts, but this friendly community shares the same intimate vibe of its more central neighbors. Colorful homes replete with blooming gardens line Mission Terraces surprisingly sunny streets, and local markets and pizza parlors are more common than strip malls and national chains. Although its bounded by several transportation corridors (freeways and BART stations included) Mission Terrace manages to remain quiet while providing quick access to energetic nighttime neighborhoods."
