Lede,"Dogpatch is a can-do neighborhood that rose from waterfront ruins. Having recently converted dockside warehouses and factories into live-in artist studios and hip shared spaces, it's steadily gaining notoriety as a neighborhood to watch. Dogpatch is a gastronomically enticing destination, and foodies are flocking to its farm-to-table restaurant scene. Better known for its culinary offerings than its late-night culture, Dogpatch's public transit options take after-8 party animals anywhere they want to go."
