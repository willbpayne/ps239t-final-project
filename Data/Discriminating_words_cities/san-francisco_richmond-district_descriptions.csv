Lede,"Bordering Golden Gate Park to the south and the Presidio to the north, the Richmond District is an under-the-radar residential neighborhood surrounded by green space. Although its not the height of hipness, its important to note that the Richmond is not uncool. Instead, its a laid-back locale with simple and delicious dining options and friendly neighborhood bars. It takes time, but this west San Francisco neighborhoods bus routes provide direct access to the citys center."
