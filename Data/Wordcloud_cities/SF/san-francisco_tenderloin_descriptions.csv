Name,Tenderloin
Block_Quotes,"['The Upper Tenderloin is now a night-time hot-spot. Young people from all over flock to the bars, hookah lounges, late-night restaurants, and general zeitgeist. It does have a bit of a ""bummy"" aspect during the day, as of late. This section of town, being close to the theater district for over a century, has long been a demimonde district of the city... However, it is most definitely not quaint or gentrified, and probably never will be.', 'The Tenderloin neighborhood has a long history with a dense and diverse population. If you are not crazy about noise and activity, this might not be the place for you. It is not a neighborhood with sidewalk cafes and coffee shops -- but it is extremely close to those that are.']"

Lede,"Fidgety loiterers frequent the streets of the Tenderloin, a fickle San Francisco neighborhood not necessarily suited to certain palates. Raw to the core, the Tenderloin is an abrasively honest neighborhood in the heart of the city. Cheap hole-in-the-wall eateries and paling historic buildings provide the backdrop to this neighborhoods cast of sidewalk occupants. Recognizing the Tenderloin for its rich diversity and architectural potential, San Franciscans are working to redefine their dubious heartland."
