Block_Quotes,"[""The location was fantastic. Step out the door, and you are in San Francisco's vibrant Chinatown. And if you head just a block north, you enter into little Italy and Telegraph Hill. The rest of the city awaits just a short walk or trolly bus ride beyond, making the [neighborhood] a great base location."", 'For those seeking a quiet suburban experience, you may want to look elsewhere as this part of the city is very lively, a little raucous, but ALWAYS fun. A true San Francisco experience not to be missed.']"

Lede,"As North Americas oldest and largest Chinatown, this densely packed neighborhood maintains a sense of order amid its chaos. Street vendors crowd the sidewalks and shouts emanate from narrow alleyways as butcher shops display their exotic array of available meats. Strung with lanterns and sheltered by pagoda roofs, Chinatown's kitsch shops, specialty stores, and mouthwatering hole-in-the-wall eateries range from immaculately organized to endearingly disheveled in this iconic San Francisco neighborhood."
