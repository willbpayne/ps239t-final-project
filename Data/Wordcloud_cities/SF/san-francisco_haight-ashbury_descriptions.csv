Lede,"Born of counterculture roots, this creative-minded slice of San Francisco is a haven for urban hippies and vintage enthusiasts. Haight-Ashburys colorful architecture, boldly nostalgic shops, and eclectic (and most likely organic) cafes and restaurants exude a magnetism that draws many to the neighborhood. Its laissez-faire attitude also attracts folks on the fringe, so Haight-Ashbury might not be your cup of yerba mate should you dislike being approached for spare change."
