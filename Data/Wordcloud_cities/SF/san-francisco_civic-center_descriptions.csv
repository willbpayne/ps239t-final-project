Block_Quotes,"[""The civic center neighborhood might seem a bit iffy but I never had a problem and there are lots of people about even late at night. There is of course some city noise (traffic, sirens) but that didn't bother me."", 'A word to those who have never been to or are unfamiliar with San Francisco: There are a lot of homeless people in this city. With that said, more often than not, the homeless population mostly keep to themselves but may occasionally ask for change. Just act like you live here... be aware of your surroundings, and enjoy the many beautiful and amazing facets of this wonderful city.']"

Lede,"Home to San Franciscos City Hall and surrounded by equally important-looking buildings, Civic Center is the citys main site for culturally significant activity. Flanked by an opera house, a library, a museum, and two plazas, this esteemed-seeming neighborhood is known to become seedy after sunset. Located in the heart of the city,  Civic Center is easy to get into (or out of) thanks to multiple MUNI and BART lines."
