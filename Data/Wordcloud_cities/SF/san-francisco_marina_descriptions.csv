Lede,"A dreamy neighborhood on the edge of the bay, the Marina entices shoppers, diners, and picnickers to crowd its boutique-lined streets and hilly green space. Offering unmatched views of the Golden Gate Bridge and front row seats to witness waters ferocity, this high-end haunt can be a bit intimidating. Sporting a come-hither type of trendiness, the Marina is busy with window browsers by day and bar hoppers by night."
