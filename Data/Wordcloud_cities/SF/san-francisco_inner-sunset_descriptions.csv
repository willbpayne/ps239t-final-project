Lede,"Besides the Inner Sunsets rolling fog, theres nothing bleak about this funky neighborhood. Bordering Golden Gate Park and home to University of California, San Francisco campus, the Inner Sunset remains close to nature without losing its big-city edge. Corner markets and a variety of ethnic eateries feed the local student population, whose laid-back presence creates a small-town feel just a quick ride away from the citys center."
