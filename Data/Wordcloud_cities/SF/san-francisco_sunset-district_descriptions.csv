Lede,"Salty ocean air and ever-present fog blanket the Sunset District. Undaunted by dampness, rows of modest stucco homes share the Outer Sunsets mostly quiet streets with locally beloved produce co-ops, casual restaurants, and cheeky cafes. This serene neighborhood feels far removed (and indeed takes some time to reach) from San Franciscos city center. However, the Outer Sunsets inviting green spaces and sandy shores make the misty adventure worth the time for urban beachcombers."
