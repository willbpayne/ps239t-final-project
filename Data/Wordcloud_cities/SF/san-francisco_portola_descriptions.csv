Lede,"As a little-known neighborhood leaning toward the outskirts of San Francisco, Portola maintains a simple community feel. This unassuming residential area is home to independent bakeries, family-run pharmacies, and beloved McLaren Park. Although it shares a border with two infamously rough neighborhoods, Portola is a quiet community that takes care of itself. Public transportation is not convenient here, but the neighborhood is easily accessible by carPortola is situated at the intersection of two major interstates."
