Lede,"As a nature-lovers alternative to the urban landscape of the city, Parkside is nearer to the beach than it is to downtowns bustling plazas. Low-key restaurants line Parksides undulating streets, and the community is a simple mix of laid-back residents. This neighborhoods proximity to the Pacific Ocean creates a constant blanket of fog and lends it an air of misty surrealism. Although Parkside keeps to itself, night owls can take MUNI for livelier after-hours amusement."
