Lede,"As a sunny neighborhood where you can usually find an open parking space, Potrero Hill defies San Francisco stereotypes. This quiet neighborhood hugs the curves of the citys eastern hills, offering stunning views of the Financial District and the SF Bay. While Potrero Hill is home base for many laid-back local haunts and casual music venues, this polite area leaves it to nearby neighborhoods like SoMa and the Mission District to provide edgier entertainment options."
