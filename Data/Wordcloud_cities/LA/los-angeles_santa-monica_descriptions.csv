Lede,"Cliffs cascade into the coast in Santa Monica, an autonomous west Los Angeles locale defined by its easy-going attitude and stylish mindset. A quintessentially-California beach town, Santa Monica's blend of surf, sand, and sun attract Angelenos and outsiders to promenade its shopping plazas, its boardwalk, and Montana Avenue, its chic boutique-filled corridor. If you're in Santa Monica without a car, you'll feel slightly sequestered on the coast. Trust us, the sunshine makes up for it."
