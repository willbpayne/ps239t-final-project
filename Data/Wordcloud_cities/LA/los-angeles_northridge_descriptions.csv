Lede,"Having survived the cataclysmic quake in 1994, Northridge continues to shake, rattle, and roll with the help of its university's active and animated scholars. When Northridge's students and suburban families aren't perusing new styles at their local mall, they're likely taking in panoramic views of the Valley from atop the Santa Susana Mountains. Getting to LA's Downtown requires a trek, so consider traffic when taking a car or timeliness when taking the trainit's about an hour journey on the Metrolink."
