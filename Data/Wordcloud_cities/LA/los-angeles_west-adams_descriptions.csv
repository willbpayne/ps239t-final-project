Block_Quotes,"[""We live on a very diverse urban street - young working class families, older neighborhood folks, USC students, loud teens, gay and straight couples, even nuns. There is always a lot of liveliness happening.  This is an older residential neighborhood, so there aren't trendy local businesses.""]"

Lede,"One of Los Angeles' oldest neighborhoods, West Adams embraces its history and plans for its future. The grandeur of late 19th century Colonials coalesces with the cramped study tables of nearby USC students. More than mansions and scholars, this central LA neighborhood attributes its liveliness to its active Latino and LGBTQ communities. West Adams stretches along two freeways, so getting around this daytime destination is easiest by car. If you're without wheels, don't dismaypublic transportation is possible."
