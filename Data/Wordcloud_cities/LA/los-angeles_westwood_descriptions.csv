Lede,"An almost-coastal village with cosmopolitan sensibilities, Westwood's premier restaurants, revered playhouses, and top-notch university campus uphold LAs reputation for looking good. Catering to both students and starlets, Westwoods sleek cafes and wily street performers walk a fine line between intimidatingly chic and invitingly approachable. Located directly off of the 405 (the four-oh-five), Westwood is easy to get to with a car. Another good-looking detail? Getting to Santa Monica and Beverly Hills is easy from Westwood, too."
