Lede,"An unconventional enclave along Los Angeles' coast, Venice combines alternative values with counter-culture street cred. A carnival atmosphere permeates throughout this beach town, emanating from its fire-breathing street performers and its spoken-word sidewalk expressionists. Venice may be over ten miles away from Downtown, but its endearingly outlandish mixture of upscale boutiques and seedy entertainment make the trek by bus or car infinitely worth it."
