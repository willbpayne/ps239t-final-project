Lede,"Eagle Rock maintains a low-key vibe despite its soaring accolades as northeast LA's most lavishly rooted-in-bohemia neighborhoods.Jukeboxes still jam in the neighborhood's returned-to-trendy diners and vinyl still spins in its used bookstores.This imperceptibly discerning destination is so copacetic, you'll forget you're in the movie-making capital of the nation until you see a film crew along its quintessentially quaint main boulevards. Take five, hike to the top of its eponymous rock, and breathe in crisp nostalgia."
