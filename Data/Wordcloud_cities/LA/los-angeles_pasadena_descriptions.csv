Lede,"A big city overshadowed by a much bigger city, Pasadena promises evening entertainment shrouded in small-town serenity. Culturally stimulating and classically-inclined, Pasadena's favorite pastimes include museum excursions and community-wide parades. This wholesome area isn't the urban metropolis that is Los Angeles properand that's exactly why people love it. When you want to get to LA's soaring edifices or sandy beaches, hop on the Metro Gold Line."
