Lede,"Despite its directly-next-to-Downtown location, Mid-City manages to feel strikingly suburban. The exclusivity of mid-century Mid-City transformed into a come-one-come-all attitude that is as equally celebrated in the neighborhood's comedy clubs as it is in its corner stores. For quiet palm-tree promenades, Mid-City is the place to be. If you're eager to explore LA's notoriously late-night after-after party offerings, you'll have to take the bus."
