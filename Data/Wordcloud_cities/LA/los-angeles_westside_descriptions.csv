Name,Westside
Block_Quotes,"['A quiet westside neighborhood close to UCLA, Santa Monica, Century City, Beverly Hills, and of course the beach.  Unlike many places in Los Angeles, my neighborhood is walkable and you see many people, young and old, walking and biking to work and school, and walking their dogs late at night.']"

Lede,"A tidy neighborhood tucked inside a larger area of the same name, the Westside blends contemporary conveniences like mega-malls with simple delights like old-school diners and California-style beach homes. This suburban-paced urban neighborhood connects seaside destinations like Santa Monica with boutique destinations like Beverly Hills. Movie theaters and ice cream parlors comprise the Westside's evening options, so consider venturing west to the beach or east to Downtown when you're seeking something other than silent nights."
