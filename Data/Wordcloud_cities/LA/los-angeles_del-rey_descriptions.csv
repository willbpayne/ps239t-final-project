Lede,"Beach combers continue to float further from the coast and into Del Rey, a quiet residential neighborhood between the shore and the 405 freeway. Taking after eccentric entrepreneur and influential Del Rey developer, Howard Hughes, enterprising spirits still pervade this neighborhood. Small businesses intersperse with the big-name chains that trace the neighborhood's central boulevards. Bike a mile along these main thoroughfares and you'll make it to the place where the land meets the sea. Eureka."
