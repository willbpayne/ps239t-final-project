Lede,"Little league games, half-time snacks, and shopping on Saturdays signify life in Glendale, quite possibly LA's quaintest suburb. Glendale boasts its own small downtown and big-name corporations alongside car dealerships, manicured plazas, and tree-lined streets that give its residents a wholesome atmosphere in which to play, eat, and peruse. Ten miles away from Downtown Los Angeles and mere neighborhoods away from bohemian hotspots like Eagle Rock, get anywhere from Glendale with the help of an automobile."
