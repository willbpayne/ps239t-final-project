Lede,"Roll up your right pant leg and resurrect your mom's jean jacketin Echo Park, a northeast LA neighborhood that rides bikes and reveres retro stylings. Located next to super-hip enclaves like Silver Lake, this centrally located nook caters to crowds who thrive best when ferreting out old vinyl at the local record store.
