Lede,"Floating far west of Los Angeles' Downtown, Marina del Rey ranks highest when it comes to luxury along the sea. A mixture of multi-story apartment complexes and more-than-stunning skiffs, ships, and sailboats, Marina del Rey's residents power-walk their pets and juice their breakfasts before returning to their boats for a day spent in the sun. Located next to the freeway and bordering Venice Beach and Culver City, it's easy to find off-the-water entertainment when you have a car."
