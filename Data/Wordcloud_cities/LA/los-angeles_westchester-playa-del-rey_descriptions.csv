Lede,"Although they are two distinct neighborhoods, Westchester and Playa del Rey share one another's beach town attitude and academic-friendly atmosphere. Westchester's high-traffic thoroughfares give way to Playa del Rey's low-key coastline. Their down-to-earth vibe doesn't leave much room for super hip bars and restaurants. Instead, apartment complexes, beach bungalows, and modest, shingled single-stories share elbowroom in these two neighborhoods connected by the ultra-urban convenience of nearby LAX airport."
