Lede,"Private estates shake hands with milkshake-serving diners in Toluca Lake. An endearingly kitschy mix of contemporary refinement and nostalgic entertainment, this northwest LA neighborhood trades the glitz of nearby Hollywood for the good family values of the 50's. Tucked into the San Fernando Valley, Toluca Lake's residential streets remain quiet even when Riverside Drive buzzes as the night begins. Navigating Toluca Lake is easy with a cartake a spin in an antique Ford and you'll fit right in."
