Lede,"Elegantly disheveled, Los Feliz mixes a meticulously curated image with an ultra-cool attitude. Idyllic homes rest in the shade of this north LA neighborhood's hillside foliage while its observatory rises above the chaparral and offers otherworldly views of the sprawling city below. Spend your afternoon sipping free-trade coffee and snoozing on the grass at Griffith Park. Spend your evenings swirling craft cocktails and screening films at its historic theatre. Los Feliz leaves you happy."
