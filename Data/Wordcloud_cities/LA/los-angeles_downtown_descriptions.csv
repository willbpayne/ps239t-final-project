Lede,"There's more than meets the eye in Downtown's concrete jungle of freeways, skyscrapers, sculptures, and convention centers. From its wholesale flower market and fashion district to its historic landmarks and gallery-sponsored art walks, Downtown is where diverging interests converge in this star-studded city on the coast. Take the time to explore this seemingly-intimidating neighborhood and you'll notice that it's friendlier than expectedpeople are nice and public transportation is accessible. Downtown, everyone's waiting for you."
