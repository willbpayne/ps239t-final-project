Lede,"Hand-tailored suits and couture handbags strut through Beverly Hills, a label-friendly Los Angeles destination whose celebrity status only soars higher when grouped with its star-studded neighbors, Bel Air and West Hollywood. Away from famed Rodeo Drive's designer boutiques and swanky cafes, exclusive mansions hide in the hillsides to shield themselves from the paparazzi. Beverly Hills' untouchably flawless exterior comes at a cost, so be ready to hear the cha-ching of registers and the applause of credit card companies when you arrive."
