Lede,"A star was born when production studios relocated to Culver City in the early 1900s. Blending nostalgia with right-now trends, Culver City tugs on the heartstrings and pushes the envelope. Ice-skating rinks, tree-lined streets, and community theatres temper Culver City's pool-sharking bars, bare-faced art galleries, and restaurants that sound best when their name is whispered. Even better, Downtown is reachable by public transit, but like most of LA, it's still more convenient with a car."
