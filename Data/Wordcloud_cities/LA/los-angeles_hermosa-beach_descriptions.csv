Lede,"Sand in your hair and sun on your skin seldom feels as right as it does in Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles' South Bay's eclectic answer to its northern boardwalk counterpart, Venice Beach. One of three South Bay beach communities, Hermosa Beach's effervescent vitality sets it apart from more mature Manhattan Beach, while its offbeat attitude keeps it feeling funkier than nearby Redondo Beach. Surf in the morning, shop during the day, and sip or slosh in the eveningthis energetic seaside enclave rises with the sun, outlasts its light, and often parties until dawn."
