Lede,"Food trucks, general stores, and Latino bodegas line Van Nuys, a suburban LA neighborhood that swims in the center of the San Fernando Valley. Striking contrasts convene in this seventies-feeling localerows of shiny new car dealers park adjacent to retro-styled burger stands and mismatched thrift centers. In Van Nuys, you won't find warehouse-turned-art-lofts or expansive green spaces. Instead, you'll find adobe-colored single-story homes, south-of-the-border flavors, and boulevards shaded by palm fronds next to the neighborhood's train station."
