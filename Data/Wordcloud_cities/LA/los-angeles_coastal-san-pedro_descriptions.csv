Lede,"Located on a little peninsula in south Los Angeles, San Pedro sports a small-town atmosphere despite its occupation as one of the city's most active seaports. Although lobster festivals and lighthouse tours enliven the neighborhood by day, San Pedro's citizens retire to beach-inspired bungalows soon after the sun sets. San Pedro's community-run corner shops contribute to its local charm, but when it's big-city anonymity you seek you'll have to find a car. The good news? The 110 freeway is minutes away."
