Lede,"Family-owned shops tuck behind corporate-conglomerate enterprises in Pico Rivera, a city all its own just ten miles southeast of Downtown LA. Splashes of color enliven this modest community's park spaces while splashes of lime accentuate the flavors of its fresh corn tortillas and carne asada tacos. Pico Rivera's wide boulevards and multi-freeway proximity account for its superior automobileaccessibility, but the area's bus lines will also drop you in Downtown should you have a few extra minutes to spare."
