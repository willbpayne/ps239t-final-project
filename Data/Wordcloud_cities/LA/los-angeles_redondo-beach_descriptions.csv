Lede,"Redondo Beach touts all the trappings of its fellow Beach Cities, Hermosa and Manhattan, but it's decidedly more reserved. This ocean-view neighborhood's quainter nature stems from its distance from Downtown. What it lacks in big-city proximity it makes up for with surf, sun, and pier side amusements. Pedal away the day along Redondo's favorite recreation trail, The Strand, and feast on fresh seafood on the pier by nightthis organic oceanfront neighborhood embraces exercise and wholesome living."
