Lede,"Creative pursuits drive North Hollywood's artistic culture. In NoHo, you're welcome to blog with a beanie on while LA's next ""it"" girl practices her monologue at the cafe table next to you. By day, this San Fernando Valley neighborhood mixes a stylish thrift-store aesthetic with its curated retro-inspired atmosphere. By night, theatres glow neon, tumblers shake, and cocktails get two straws in this classically unrefined evening destination."
