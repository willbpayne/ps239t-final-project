Lede,"Welcome to Hollywood, where stars are embedded in the sidewalk, stars walk the sidewalks, and people pretending to be stars solicit money for street performances.

From the neighborhood's tourist-centric chaos along Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards to its under-the-radar art galleries and friendly farmers' markets, Hollywood makes room for fresh talent and veteran Angelenos alike."
