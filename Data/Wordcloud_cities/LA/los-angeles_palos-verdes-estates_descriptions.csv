We have a rural feel yet close to cultural stops like the Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Getty Museum, walking distance to the beach, and an hour from Disneyland. Plenty of golf courses. Biking and walking paths abound.']"

Lede,"A majestic coastal community, Palos Verdes promises stunning ocean views and stellar vistas of the city, too. Million-dollar mansions, sprawling parklands, and wild peacocks make this luxurious neighborhood a vacation destination unlike any other. Though a quick drive from the airport, Palos Verdes is a world away from the cacophony of LAdont expect honking horns or wild nights. The only sound you should expect to hear is the constant crashing of the ocean's waves."
