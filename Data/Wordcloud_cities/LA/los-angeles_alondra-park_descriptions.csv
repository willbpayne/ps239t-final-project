Lede,"Alondra Park supports a subtle blend of student activity and family outings. The neighborhood inheritsits name from its village green space, a beloved community destination for skating, dribbling, fishing, and wishing. A few miles inland from Manhattan Beach and a substantially few miles more from Downtown LA, Alondra Park straddles the border between quiet residential respite and distant suburban sprawl. Three major freeways encircle Alondra Park, so covering those miles isn't too difficult with a car."
