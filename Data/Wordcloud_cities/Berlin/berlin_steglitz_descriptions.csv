Lede,"This south Berlin neighborhood challenges suburban stereotypes. Steglitz tempers the commerciality of its shopping complexes and cafes with avant-garde structures like the Bierpinsel building and Die Spiegelwand Holocaust memorial. Although this neighborhood may welcome crowds of kitsch-enthusiasts during the holidays, it remains refined for the better part of the year. Catering to sippers rather than guzzlers, Steglitz converses delicately and gets its beauty sleepall while providing central city access via its two Bahn lines."
