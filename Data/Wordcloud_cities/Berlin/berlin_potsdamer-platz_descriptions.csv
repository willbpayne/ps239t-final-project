Lede,"Potsdamer Platzs current incarnation recalls its initial purpose as a center for traffic, trade, and commerce. The manifestation of its commercialism looks a little different than it did in the pastsoaring glass buildings, futuristic shopping malls, and neon spotlights have taken the place of Potsdamer Platzs grand hotels and elegant train stations.
