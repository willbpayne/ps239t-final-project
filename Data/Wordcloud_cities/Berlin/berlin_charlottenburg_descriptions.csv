Lede,"Charlottenburg is well-suited for sophisticated evening entertainment. Filled with theatres, museums, and fine dining establishments, this west Berlin neighborhood steps out in style. During the day, Charlottenburgs palace, gardens, and palatial gardens invite countless picture-snappers to stroll its manicured paradise. Charlottenburgs high-end shopping complexes and notable cleanliness distinguish it from many of Berlins vintage and street art inclined neighborhoods, although the record shops and wheat-pasted corridors of Moabit are just a neighborhood away."
