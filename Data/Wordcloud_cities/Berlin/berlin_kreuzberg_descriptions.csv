Lede,"Contrarian ideas are born at a feverish pace in Kreuzberg. Punks, bohemians, LGBTQ individuals, and counter-culture enthusiasts have called its artfully decaying buildings home for generations. As a neighborhood founded on anti-establishment values, Kreuzberg refuses to lose its rebellious naturegraffiti covers everything, shawarma stands serve late-night revelers, and alleyways are often mistaken as bathrooms.
