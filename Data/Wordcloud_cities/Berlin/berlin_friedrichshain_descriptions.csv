Lede,"Imagine an art gallery turned inside out and youll begin to envision Friedrichshain. Single walls arent canvases for creative works, entire buildings are canvases. This zealously expressive east Berlin neighborhood forgoes social norms in favor of squatters rights and boisterous bars serving cheap brews. It doesnt always go against the graincool bars, boutiques, and cafes fill Friedrichshains bustling main streets and its intimate cinemas and riverside green spaces invite visitors to get cozy."
