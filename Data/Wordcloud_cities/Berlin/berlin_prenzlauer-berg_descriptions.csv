Block_Quotes,"['As the biggest and best preserved pre-war area in Germany (most buildings are from the 1880s), the district is getting more and more popular, but here are still loads of little stores selling fashion, vintage furniture or memorabilia of the old times.', 'Prenzlauer Berg was the first neighborhood in former East Berlin in which the wall came down, so there is a memorial park & a Museum to the Berlin Wall nearby. It is also the closest residential neighborhood to Mitte, the center of the city where you find many Monuments, Museums, and Tourist sites.', 'The location is cool - in a trendy residential neighborhood with a farmers market in the small park across the street on weekends. Trams run nearby to anywhere in the city. It is also only a few blocks from the lovely Volkspark for running, biking, playgrounds, etc.']"

Lede,"Snuggled between Berlins contemporary glass towers and austere concrete slabs, Prenzlauer Berg exudes a wholesome atmosphere comprised of tree-lined streets, colorful boutiques, and a sprightly mix of new parents and university students. The artists and alternative individuals who populated Prenzlauer Berg in the 1990s have grown up. Now, the babies of these once-upon-a-time bohemians clamor for organic soy ice cream while young scholars pass hookah hoses, exemplifying a dynamic fusion of multiple generations."
