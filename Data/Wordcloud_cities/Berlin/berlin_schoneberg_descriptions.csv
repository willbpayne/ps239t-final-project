Block_Quotes,"['Volkspark Sch\xc3\xb6neberg/Wilmersdorf is quite an attraction: extended lawns, a pond with ducks, multiple playgrounds and athletic fields - perfect for summer picnics!  The Sch\xc3\xb6neberg Town Hall was the former seat of the West Berlin municipality. It was here that John F. Kennedy gave his famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech to the people of Berlin. Since that day, the bell of freedom tolls at noon every day in his memory.', 'The historic ""Department Store of the West\xe2\x80\x98"" (or, ""Kaufhaus des Westens"" in German) is here. Those who don\'t know it yet, will definetely love it  -  and those who have already been there, can\xe2\x80\x98t live without it.  What Harrods is to a Londoner, the Lafayette to the Parisian, and Macy\'s to a New Yorker is what KaDeWe means to the Berliner. It\'s famous for its sheer incredible assortment of designer fashions, products, and delikatessen from all over the world - and always worth a day-trip.']"
