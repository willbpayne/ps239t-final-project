Lede,"Pinecrest carves a peaceful and proud neighborhood out of south Miami's tropical vegetation. A community centered on wholesome social events, down-to-earth horticulture seminars, and active residential involvement, Pinecrest makes up for its quiet evenings with its vibrant daytime pursuits. Farmers' markets, playground play dates, and community programs fill Pinecrest's neighborhood agenda. It may seem dreamlike, but Pinecrests suburban serenity is very real indeed."
