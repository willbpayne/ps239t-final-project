Lede,"Though Buena Vista's unique heritage originated over a century ago, this central Miami community's charisma is ageless. Lush tropical foliage provides a cozy canopy for quiet strolls amidst home-grown boutiques, locally-owned cafs, and a quirky blend of vintage Craftsman, Mediterranean, and Art Deco homes.
