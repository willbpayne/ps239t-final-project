Lede,"Just west of Downtown lies Miamis Cuban capital, Little Havana. Almost exclusively Hispanic, this zealously colorful neighborhood's streets criss-cross an area where music sounds livelier, food tastes zestier, and the air seems to embrace visitors with a don't-worry-about-a-thing warmth. Don a guayabera, order a plate of ropa vieja, and grab a cafecito on a patio filled with domino-playing locals. Bienvenidos a Little Havana!"
