Lede,"A pocket-sized neighborhood with broad appeal, Midtown's color-flooded walls, outdoor cafes, and fine food purveyors all snuggle into an invitingly promenadeable collection of streets and shops. Skate to the nearest couture coffee shop and join Miami's next big artist in enjoying a small-batch roast. In Midtown, you're next to creative hotspots like Wynwood and Edgewater, and you're perfectly positioned to experience mainland destinations like Brickell via the Metrobus."
