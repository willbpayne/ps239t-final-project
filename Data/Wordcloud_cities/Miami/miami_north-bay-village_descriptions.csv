Lede,"Once a Rat Pack respite, this three-island destination has gracefully evolved into a refined Floridian refuge. Embraced by Biscayne Bay and a 20 minute drive to Miami's most acclaimed hotspots, North Bay Village is a convivial neighborhood comprised of retro facades, breathtaking vistas, and champagne lunches, brunches, and dinners. Cars drive slow and the pace moves slower in North Bay Village, so grab a spot on the patio, pop the cork, and enjoy the view."
