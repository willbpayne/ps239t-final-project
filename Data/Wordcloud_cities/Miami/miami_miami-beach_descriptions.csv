Lede,"A touch more sedate than its neighbor to the south, South Beach,Miami Beach is a peninsular paradise that boasts hot sun and cool entertainment. Affectionately called ""The Beach,"" this vacation destination is a short trip from the mainland yet far away from stressful city living. Spend the day sprawled along the sand and the evening perusing Collins Ave for sultry dance clubs and twice-shaken martinis. Early-risers and night owls find the Miami they want in Miami Beach."
