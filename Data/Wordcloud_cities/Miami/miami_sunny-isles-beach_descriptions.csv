Lede,"Ultra-luxury condos boast resplendent views of endless horizons in Sunny Isles Beach. Serenely tucked between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean, this ritzy neighborhood prizes private beaches, private yachts, and personal trainers. Sundry amenities and simple groceries are available, but an energetic entertainment scene is harder to find. Home to few but envied by many, Sunny Isles Beach is the kind of neighborhood that residents venture out of because they have to, not because they want to."
