Lede,"Close enough to Downtown to be cool by association, East Downtown's grittier character sets it apart from its neighbor's highly trafficked path. Worn-in hole-in-the-wall bars, casual dives, and mural adorned bodegas lend East Downtown a weathered, artistic edge. Set its nonconformist values against the serene backdrop of Lady Bird Lake, and it becomes clear why many venture out to this East Austin neighborhood."
