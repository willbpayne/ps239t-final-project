Lede,"Located just north of Downtown, Hancock is home to ambitious professionals, laid-back creative types, and University of Texas students. Getting around this residential neighborhood often involves walking, jogging, or biking to its local bars, cafes, and eateries renowned for their outdoor patios and intimate vibes. Hancocks soothing atmosphere makes it seem far away from 6th Streets noise, but jump on the interstate bordering this neighborhood and youll be Downtown before the band goes on break."
