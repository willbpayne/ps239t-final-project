Lede,"Dawson exudes a quiet sort of cool. While its northern neighbor (SoCo) throws all-night parties, Dawson knows that its mellow dive bars and laid-back lounges will always attract admirers. This charismatic residential neighborhood is peppered with friendly local businesses buoyed by a tight-knit community. Across the lake from Downtown, St. Edwards University borders Dawson and contributes a youthful glow to this already charming neighborhood."
