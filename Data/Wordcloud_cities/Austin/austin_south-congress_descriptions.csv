Lede,"Couture food trailers, funky shops, and a spirited atmosphere typify this trendy neighborhood dedicated to keeping Austin weird. Directly across the lake from Downtown, SoCo (how the hip kids say South Congress these days) brims with things to see, places to shop, and bars and restaurants to drink and dine. This neon colored neighborhood tends to make a lasting impression, and SoCos cool attitude guarantees the crowds never thin regardless of the time."
