Lede,"East Riverside is home to creative types making ends meet, students seeking cheap rents, and a seemingly ever-present shady loiterer or two. Although East Riverside is laden with strip malls and nondescript apartment complexes, its on-the-lake location and waterside biking and running trails add panache to the neighborhood. Combine that with East Riversides reputation for being a musicians homestead, and this neighborhood may soon be hitting a higher note."
