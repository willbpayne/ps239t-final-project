Lede,"North Loop is North Austins answer to the edgy entertainment found south of Lady Bird Lake in SoCo. Walk into North Loops vintage stores, record shops, or hybrid coffee shop-cocktail spots (they give new meaning to baristas), and youll set new trends upon exiting their brightly colored buildings. Located steps away from this laid-back neighborhoods cool hangouts, modest single-story homes intermingle with modern apartment complexes along tree-lined streets."
