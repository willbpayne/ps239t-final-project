Name,Little Italy
Block_Quotes,"['You will thoroughly enjoy the quiet neighborhood (Italian restaurants close around 10pm and it becomes quiet) and the ability to get almost anywhere in Manhattan within 20-30 minutes. Along with the Italian and obviously Chinese cuisines, almost any type of cuisine can be found within a 10 minute walk through SoHo or Lower East Side.', 'The region of Lower Manhattan bordered by the Bowery to the east and Broadway to the west, Houston Street to the north and Canal on its southern boundary was once home to a thriving manufacturing center. Its very difficult to imagine now but the area once produced everything from horse carriages to lingerie.\r \r The legacy of these magnificent factory buildings is wonderful.']"

Lede,"A tiny and iconic NYC neighborhood, Little Italy comprises a few bustling blocks packed to the brim with colorful decorations, enticing aromas, and Italian restaurants that exude an amusingly kitschy vibe. Little Italy sure is small, and you dont have to walk far to experience another country altogetherChinatown is steps away! This neighborhoods charming peculiarity and lively atmosphere act as Manhattans magnet for carbohydrate-craving crowds."
