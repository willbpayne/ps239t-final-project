Lede,"Downtown Brooklyn serves as the boroughs civic and commercial center. Important looking people enter and exit this neighborhood's marble office buildings during business hours. Plenty of adorable shops and knick-knack stalls line Downtown Brooklyns main avenues, but the neighborhood noticeably settles down after the clock strikes five. Public transit options abound in Downtown Brooklyn, so getting anywhere else from here is a breeze."
