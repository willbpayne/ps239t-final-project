Lede,"Pre-war buildings and post-college co-eds fill the streets in Murray Hill. Although this boisterous locale is known for its raucous nightlife and hip cafes, Murray Hill offers more than countless places to party. Nineteenth century townhouses add a touch of sophistication to its mix of nondescript apartment complexes. For a low-key weekday meal or a loud and late-night round of drinks, Murray Hills got something that fits the bill."
