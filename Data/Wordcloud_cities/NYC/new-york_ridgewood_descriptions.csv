Lede,"Ridgewoods modest neighborhood corner stores and old-world meat markets lend it an unpretentious and approachable air. This seemingly time-defying Queens mainstay doesnt top the charts for hip hideouts or posh nightclubs. Instead, its pragmatic populace enjoys a slow-paced lifestyle that consists of breezy chitchat and sanguine stoop sitting. Multiple subway lines serve as Ridgewoods connection to bolder NYC neighborhoods."
