Lede,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, popularly known as Bed-Stuy (sounds like: Bed-Sty), is located in central Brooklyn and nudges up against ultra-hip Williamsburg. A historic neighborhood that boasts both pristine brownstones and unkempt storefronts, generations-old Bed-Stuy residents share their streets with newcomers and hip kids. Although Bed-Stuy bears an unsavory reputation, its tight-knit community's dedication to their neighborhood continues to support improvements as renovating bars and cafes increasingly join its cadre of locally-owned businesses."
