Name,Red Hook
Block_Quotes,"[""...a unique little neighborhood. Loved the local swimming pool and the great cafes and bars close by. Red Hook is just over the water from Manhattan and combines an interesting mix of portside 'industria' with public housing and the artsy middle class."", ""Red Hook is a unique neighborhood- it's near the water with several piers and fantastic views of the bay and the Statue of Liberty, with coffee shops, cafes, bars, etc. It's an incredible corner of the city, check out Van Brunt Street on Yelp!""]"

Lede,"Steadily evolving from its rough roots, the face of Red Hook is changing as artists and youngsters congregate in this industrial and isolated maritime neighborhood. Although Red Hooks artistic reputation is gaining recognition, its entertainment scene is still finding its sea legs. Other Brooklyn neighborhoods promise livelier activity, but they are best reached by bike or car as Red Hook lacks a direct subway connection."

Photo_Captions,"[""Red Hook's dilapidated beginnings are transforming into distinctly artistic ends. Discarded wood turns into radiant wall space."", 'And old warehouses are repurposed as cafes, community centers, and music venues.', ""Often compared to a seaside village rather than a big-city destination, Red Hook's peeling paint and washed-up-on-the-shore aesthetic remind of times passed."", ""Red Hook lacks direct subway access. It's one of the many reasons the neighborhood appeals to a resident artistic community."", 'Its wide open spaces and relative isolation lend artists the time and space needed for spirited creation.', 'And simple relaxation.']"
