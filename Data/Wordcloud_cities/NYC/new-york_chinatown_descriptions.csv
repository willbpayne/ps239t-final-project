Lede,"Get lost in Chinatowns jam-packed labyrinthine streets. As a crowd-pleasing place to explore (despite the smell), Chinatown offers hole-in-the-wall restaurants, open-air fish markets (the source of the smell), and entertaining souvenir shops. Most of the centuries-old apartment buildings in Chinatown are tenement-style, which accounts for this neighborhoods dense and noisy atmosphere. Centrally located, Chinatown is served by multiple subway lines and borders neighborhoods like Soho and Civic Center."
