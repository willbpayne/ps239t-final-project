Block_Quotes,"[""[...] the hustle and bustle of eclectic Union Square Park goes about daily life. The people, the Farmers Market, the dining and shopping are the Best the City has to offer. This is truly one of New York's Iconic destinations."", ""Madison Square Park is a beautiful park where you can get NYC's best hamburger from restaurateur Danny Meyer's Shake Shack - the line can be a mile long but it is worth the wait. In the summertime, there is an art installation in the park and there is free music entertainment at night, plus a big screen projects the US Open Championship, during the day.""]"

Lede,"This ultra-busy crossroads exudes a laid-back attitude in a fast-paced environment. Flatiron, named after its famously triangular Flatiron Building, is a veritable spectacle of big-city life. Suits and ties share the sidewalks with skateboarders, protesters, and peddlers, while droves of people-watchers take in the day in Madison Square Park. Bustling by day, Flatiron becomes quieter (if only a little) during the evening. Centrally located,Flatiron's congestion and crowds only add to its metropolitan mystique."
