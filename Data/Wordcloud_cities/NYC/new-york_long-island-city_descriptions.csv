Lede,"Long Island Citys extra-wide roadways lend the neighborhood a sprawling and somewhat barren feel. Look beyond its expansive avenues and youll be astounded by the top-notch public works adorning the fences, walls, and sidings of Long Island Citys warehouses and factory buildings. Galleries and show spaces in this Queens neighborhood have attracted artists in large quantities, and this once industrial hub now showcases their creative and colorful talents."
