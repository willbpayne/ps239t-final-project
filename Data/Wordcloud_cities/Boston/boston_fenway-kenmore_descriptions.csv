Lede,"The unceasing activity of Fenway/Kenmore infuses its surrounding streets with unbridled energy. Located near numerous universities and Bostons Museum of Fine Arts, this neighborhood encourages rigorous intellectual pursuits. But when pencils are down and ball caps are on, Fenway/Kenmore comes alive with cheering fans, Fenway Frank carts, and rowdy crowds as Red Sox Nation gives new meaning to fanaticism. Kenmores basement beer bars and upscale restaurants offer respite from the raucous commotion along Fenways thoroughfares."
