Lede,"Little bodegas and big ideas characterize this tiny Boston suburb. Chelseas active seaport and merchant industry contribute to the citys gritty reputation, but many have high hopes for Chelsea as its old buildings are transformed into sustainable loft complexes. Boutiques and cafes are slowly moving in, but the citys corner markets remain its most popular gathering posts. The commuter rail and several bus lines connect Chelsea to Cambridge and Boston."
