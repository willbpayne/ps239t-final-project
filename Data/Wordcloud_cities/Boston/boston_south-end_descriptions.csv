Lede,"Polished people walk well-groomed designer dogs between South Ends perfectly manicured parks and couture restaurants and cocktail lounges. Although a ritzy vibe emanates from South Ends classic brownstones, it tempers its upscale atmosphere with down-to-earth residents who happen to shop organically, buy gluten-free biscuits for their pets, and often refer to their neighborhoods trendy boutiques as fab. Conveniently located minutes from Downtown, everything offered by this chic locale is top-notch."
