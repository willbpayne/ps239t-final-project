Block_Quotes,"[""The area is actually pretty cool - we expected there wouldn't be much there because of the distance from the city centre, but there's actually a lot going on there. Plenty of shops, cafes, and places to eat. Would definitely recommend!"", ""The oldest, continuously run independent movie house is in Coolidge Corner. It shows amazing films that you won't see anywhere else and it is right across from Brookline Booksmith, a fantastic independently-owned bookstore.""]"

Lede,"Expensive cheese and fine wine conjure visions of a Brookline dinner party. Behind the white picket fences of this well-groomed neighborhood, children play hide-and-seek with their au pairs. Although Brookline may adhere to traditional tastes, that doesnt mean it lacks panache. For date nights, impromptu picnics, or weekend window-shopping, this Boston border towns theatres, parks, and boutiques have you covered. Your dreams of big-city buzz need not disappearDowntown is a short T ride away."
