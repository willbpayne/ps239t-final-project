Lede,"Government Centers calculated pace runs like clockwork. Civic employees and downtown professionals overflow its austere central plaza during their morning commute and flood its outbound trains at days end. In the interim, stark concrete edifices, well-placed gyms and bagel shops, and the occasional skateboarder occupy this business-minded locale. Located in the heart of Downtown directly next to Faneuil Hall and serving as the Ts central hub, Government Center provides easy access to Boston and beyond."
