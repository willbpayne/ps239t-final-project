Lede,"Centuries-old cemeteries and Bostons historic Freedom Trail seamlessly blend with Downtowns modern additionstowering skyscrapers, sleek museums, and Dunkin Donuts kiosks. Although Downtown contains most of the citys tallest buildings, the neighborhood is small enough that you dont feel swallowed by their shadows. When youre looking for a break from Downtowns foot-traffic, relax at the nations oldest city park, Boston Common, or its adjacent emerald gem, the resplendent Boston Public Gardens."
