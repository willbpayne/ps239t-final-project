Lede,"Newton may be a residential town, but it defies the stereotypes of suburban living. You dont need a car to access Newtons independent restaurants, bakeries, and bookshops. Instead, the neighborhoods village-inspired atmosphere seems to warrant a slower-paced lifestyle that rewards relaxing on rocking chairs and cheering for the local little league team.
