Lede,"It wasn't until the 1990s that the New U emerged from the shadow of the 1968 MLK riots. Today, DC has once again embraced the neighborhood's creative spirit. Known as Black Broadway in the 1920s, the neighborhood maintains the legacy of Duke Ellington and Billy Taylor with a host of hopping music venues featuring avant garde jazz, mainstream hip hop, and alt-rock. Tucked among the historic row houses are DCs best Caribbean and soul-food restaurants."
