Lede,"Adjacent to Nationals Park and one of the few residential areas in Southwest DC, this neighborhood has been evolving at a rapid pace. Much of the area consists of glass-facaded condominium complexes separated by wide, well-lit pedestrian thoroughfaresmany of which lead towards DC's National Mall. Providing its laid-back residents with plenty of places to eat, drink, and make merry along the river's edge, Southwest Waterfront is continually adding restaurants, cafes, and exciting nightlife haunts to its entertainment repertoire."
