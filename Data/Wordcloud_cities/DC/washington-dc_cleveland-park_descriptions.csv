Lede,"The blue bloods of Washington inhabit the side streets of green, gently rolling Cleveland Park. While suburban-style barbecues and dinner parties often serve as the centerpiece of this village-within-a-citys social life, its energetic denizens often wander to the host of the bright eateries and casual watering holes along Connecticut Avenue. Parks, playgrounds, and well-lit streets make for a consummately family-friendly atmosphere."
