Name,16th Street Heights
Block_Quotes,"[""The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and just blocks from the hustle & bustle of Columbia Heights and the quaint local establishments of Petworth. It's a fantastic neighborhood full of diversity, creativity, and cheer."", ""A variety of unique eateries, coffee shops, bars and retail stores are also around the neighborhood...[it's] also in close proximity to Mt. Pleasant (quaint little neighborhood) as well as Adams Morgan (eclectic bar neighborhood) and a bike or bus ride away from U Street Corridor, Dupont and Logan Circles, Chinatown, Penn Quarter and the National Mall and Monuments!"", 'The neighborhood was safe and cool with a few bars, restaurants, and services...Two Metro stations where a few blocks away so it was really fast to get to the main attractions and museums. There is also a bicycle self-serve service in the city...it took us about 20 minutes to get downtown with these bicycles.']"

Lede,"In sharp contrast to adjacent Columbia Heights, this neighborhood shrinks from the spotlight. 16th Street Heights' patchwork residential feel - produced by several waves of settlement starting in the 1920s - creates a sense of tranquil diversity in this subdued north DC neighborhood. Public transportation is limited (and drivers should watch out for oversized strollers and inattentive jaywalkers). The neighborhood doesn't boast much in the way of shopping or nightlife, so 16th Street Heights isnt particularly exciting after dark."
