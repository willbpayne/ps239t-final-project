Lede,"Regal DC blends with upstart attitudes in Logan Circle, a neighborhood as equally known for its stately architecture as it is for its hip cafes and trendy specialty stores. This neighborhoods two historic districts (not one, but two) boast some of the citys most sought-after nocturnal hotspots, including one of DCs most beloved beer bars. There are several Metro stops nearby, but Logan Circle lacks its ownthis keeps the crowds at bay."
