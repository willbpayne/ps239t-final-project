Lede,"When Nationals' Park opened in 2008, it drastically changed the character of the neighborhood surrounding the eponymous shipyard. Gone are the anything-goes nightclubs and adult-themed shops; theyve been replaced with large redevelopment projects and a slew of family-friendly establishments. When the home team is in play, the area buzzes. Otherwise, it can feel a little desolate when the Nationals are away."
