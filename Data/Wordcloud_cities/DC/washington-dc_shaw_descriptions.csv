Lede,"Most of Shaws commercial action is centered on nearby U St. Corridor, a local choice for good food and good fun. The rest of the neighborhood is largely given over to row houses and friendly, independent businesses. Students from nearby Howard University keep the area feeling young at heart, while great transportation links to DC's downtown areas contribute to Shaw's bustling atmosphere. Although its residential streets become sleepy in the evening, palpable energy emanates from some of DC's newest hotspots along neighboring 14th Street."
