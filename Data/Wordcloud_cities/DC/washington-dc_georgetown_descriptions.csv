Lede,"Georgetown is so immaculate, its difficult to find cracks in its sidewalks. Brightly colored awnings swing above the couture cupcake shops and dog biscuit bakeries that shade its idyllic main street. Off Georgetowns bustling thoroughfare, historic row homes (and historically rowdy frat houses) tuck themselves into cobblestoned hills. Even though the neighborhood is older than DC itself, Georgetown manages to feel young with help from its nearby university students."
