Lede,"Adams Morgan isnt known for its historic row homes or calm side streets, although it has both. Visitors flock to this neighborhood to shop for one-of-a-kind items at its independent businesses, dance the night away at its countless bars, and finish their evenings chewing on slices of late-night pizza. Although it's steps from prestigious Kalorama, Adams Morgan feels more indie than indulgent and more bottoms-up than buttoned-up."
