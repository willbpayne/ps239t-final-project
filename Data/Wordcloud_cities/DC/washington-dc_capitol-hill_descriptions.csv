Block_Quotes,"['The neighborhood was great -- full of families and dogs but also within walking distance to both H Street and Eastern Market/Barracks Row.', ""The Yards Park is a great place to play and picnic and is not well known among tourists. It hosts weekly outdoor movies (on Thursdays) in the summer and weekly (on Fridays) live music events from May - August. Eastern Market is a famous institution. It is open 6 days a week as a historic market that hosts a baker, a fishmonger, a butcher, a florist, a grocer...on the weekends, it hosts an outdoor farmers market, a huge flea market, and an artist's market - an amazing place to explore, people watch, and venue to discover great finds, great foods, and great non-traditional souvenirs and gifts.""]"

Lede,"Capitol Hill owes its name to the iconic congressional building that overlooks the neighborhood. Although its senators and representatives attend to serious business, Capitol Hill makes room for frivolity. Trading stuffiness for enthusiasm, the neighborhood sponsors street fairs and supports secondhand shops and eclectic restaurants. Its easy to navigate to and away from Capitol Hill, but who wants to leave a community where you can buy fresh lemonade from a neighbors enterprising preschooler?"
